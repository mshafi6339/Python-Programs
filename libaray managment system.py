
## **Program Structure**

### **Data Structures**

  #`Library.books`**: A **dictionary** where the key is the book title and the value is the `Book` object. This allows for fast O(1) lookups.
  #Library.members`**: A **dictionary** where the key is the member ID and the value is the `Member` object. This provides efficient access to member information.
  #`Member.borrowed_books`**: A **list** within each `Member` object to track the books they have currently borrowed.
  #`Book.history`**: A **list** within each `Book` object to store a history of borrowing events (who borrowed it and when).

### **Classes**

 #`Book`: Represents a book. It includes a `history` list to log borrowing events.
  #`Member`: Represents a library member with a unique ID, name, and a list of `borrowed_books`.
#  `Library`: The main class that manages the collections of `Book` and `Member` objects.
